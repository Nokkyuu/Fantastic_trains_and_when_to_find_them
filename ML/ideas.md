target: switching to numerical instead of classification? -> regression instead of class
checking more ML models: ANN, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, kNN
in the end: relate feature importance to EDA
Time Series Analysis
feature ideas: regions (states), distance to the different juctions, 
getting new dataset with st√∂rungsgrund ?
