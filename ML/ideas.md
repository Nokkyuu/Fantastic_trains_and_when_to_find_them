1. Predictive Modeling

	- Delay Prediction: Use the data to predict the arrival and departure delays for trains. Features could include the train name, station, planned arrival and departure times, geolocation, and historical delays.
	- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks.
	- Outcome: A model that can predict delays based on historical data and current schedule.

2. Anomaly Detection

	- Detecting Unusual Delays: Identify outliers or anomalies in train delays. This can help in identifying potential issues in the network, such as mechanical failures or unexpected events.
	- Algorithms: Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, Autoencoders.
	- Outcome: Alerts for abnormal delays that deviate significantly from the norm.

3. Clustering

	- Station or Train Clustering: Group stations or trains based on their delay patterns and geolocation. This can help in understanding regional issues or train-specific problems.
	- Algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering.
	- Outcome: Clusters of stations or trains with similar delay characteristics.

4. Time Series Analysis

	- Trend Analysis: Analyze the trends in delays over the 72-hour period. Identify peak times or conditions that lead to higher delays.
	- Techniques: ARIMA, Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
	- Outcome: Insights into when and why delays occur, enabling better planning and management.

6. Optimization

	- Schedule Optimization: Optimize the train schedules to minimize delays and improve efficiency. This can be done using historical data to adjust the planned arrival and departure times.
	- Techniques: Genetic Algorithms, Linear Programming.
	- Outcome: Improved schedules that reduce delays.

8. Causal Analysis

	- Identifying Causes of Delays: Analyze the data to identify the main factors causing delays. This could involve feature importance analysis in predictive models.
	- Techniques: Feature Importance in Random Forest, SHAP values, LIME.
	- Outcome: Insights into the primary causes of delays, enabling targeted interventions.
