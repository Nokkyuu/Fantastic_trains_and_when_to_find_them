- stations.csv is generated from the stations api, for details look into API_stations.ipynb

- StaDa.csv is generated from the StaDa API, probably better because it got the EvaNr that is usable for the timetable API
    - we can grab many more columns from the StaDa if needed

- delay.csv is the first time iteration over all train stops in germany and gabbing all arrivals and departures as well as delays
